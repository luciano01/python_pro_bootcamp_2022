# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. 
# e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, 
# the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) 
# by the square of their height (in m).

height = input('What is your Height in m? ');
weight = input('What is your Weight in kg? ');
bmi = int(weight) / (float(height) ** 2)
print(int(bmi))
